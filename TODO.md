In demo:
* Also display the E interpolants for K and GL
* Let user choose what variable to quantify over
* Allow any letters as variable names
* Add support for inputting diamond.

Various optimizations: 
* Avoid displaying double negations in the classical case
* Show neg bot as top.
* Use that (bot -> A) = top and (top -> A) = A and (A -> top) = top.
* More ambitious: Integrate an equivalence/normal form algorithm?
