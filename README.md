# UIML
Uniform Interpolation for Modal Logics K, GL and iSL

Requires opam 8.17.1
## Installation

### Dependencies
The proof library depends on `coq`, `coq-stdpp` and `coq-color`.
The demo further requires `js_of_ocaml` and `angstrom`.

All of the above are available on `opam`.


### Build instruction

The proof library compiles with `make`.
The documentation build with `make doc`.

## Documentation

The documentation generated by coqdoc is available here:
[https://hferee.github.io/UIML/toc.html](https://hferee.github.io/UIML/toc.html])


## Demo
A basic demo is also available:
[https://hferee.github.io/UIML/demo.html](https://hferee.github.io/UIML/demo.html])

It parses a modal formula and computes its various interpolants for K, GL and
iSL.
It is built by extracting the relevant coq functions to OCaml code, which is
further compiled to javascript.
